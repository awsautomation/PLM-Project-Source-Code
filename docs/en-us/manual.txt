Please read all of this document before installing or using PDMWeb.


PDMWeb: Cadmus Release (A.0)
============================

    PDMWeb is an open-source, open-development product lifecycle management
(PLM) system.  PDMWeb is still undergoing heavy development but some of the
core functions have been created and are in place as alpha code.

    If you would like to help contribute to the development of this software,
please visit the PDMWeb home page at http://pdmweb.sourceforge.net .


Requirements
============

    Web server or web hosting account running on any major operating system.
    PHP (version 4.x) with support for the database you intend to use below.
    SQL database system, one of the following:
        MySQL (3.22 or higher).
        PostgreSQL (7.0.3 or higher) [Not supported - yet!].
        Oracle (9.x or higher) [Not supported - yet!].
        DB2 (x.x or higher) [Not supported - yet!].
        MS SQL Server (7 or 2000) directly or via ODBC [Not supported - yet!].
        MS Access (2000 or XP) via ODBC [Not supported - yet!].
    Optional but recommended, the Zend Optimizer for PHP.


New Installation
================

    Download the latest version of the software from the PDMWeb web site
(http://pdmweb.sourceforge.net).

    Extract the files from the downloaded software release using either the zip
or tar utilities depending on the file downloaded.

    Upload all of the extracted files and directories from the htdocs
directory to your web server or web host to a location that can be accessed
from a web browser.  Ideally this should be a directory under the root
directory of your web server but it can be located anywhere under the web
server root.  Do not rename or move any of the files or directories from the
htdocs directory structure.

    If necessary update your web server to process files with a '.php'
extension as PHP code and 'index.php' files as the directory index file.
Hopefully if you already have PHP installed and running on your web server you
shouldn't need to do this step.  You will need to refer to your web server and
PHP documentation if you have no clue as to what I'm talking about here.

    Create a database and database user on your database server.  Grant access
to the database user to be able to create tables, modify, delete, etc. in the
database you created.  Again, if you have no idea to what I'm talking about
refer to your database software documentation.

    From a web browser access the top level directory where you installed
PDMWeb to.  If you installed the files directly under the root directory of the
web server then this should be http://mysite.com  If your web server is set up
to use index.php as a directory index then your browser should be redirected to
the installation page.

    PDMWeb has a graphical install process to provide a simple set of steps to
install the software and get your site up and running.  Follow the prompts and
input the necessary information when requested and everything should install
just fine.  Once the install has been successfully completed you should then be
redirected back to the PDMWeb main page.

    The default user ids and passwords installed as part of a standard install
are:

    Default administrator account: pdmweb pdmweb
    Default guest account: guest guest

    You will more than likely want to modify these accounts before you do too
much else especially at least changing the default administrator password.

From here you are now ready to begin building the objects and structure that
you need to implement for your specific site.


Upgrade
=======

   PDMWeb currently does not support an upgrade path.  With only one working
release and it being from an earlier package with a different methodology there
are no plans to support an upgrade from that release to this new version.

    There are also no current plans to provide upgrade paths for the different
alpha and beta development versions for this package until the first full
release of the software package.  As installs of PDMWeb increase this policy
may be revised.


Common Installation Errors
==========================

    If you have some installation errors that you would like to see included
here please send me an e-mail <mailto:merritdc@users.sourceforge.net>.

    If you have copied the new files to a location with an existing PDMWeb
installation then the browser will not be redirected to the install page.
Either manually start the install by running install.php or remove the
existing config.php file.

    Do not confuse the config.php and the install/config.php.  The
install/config.php must exist for the install program to work.

    The install needs to be able to create and write the config.php file.  If
the install fails and is complaining about not being able to create the
config.php file then check your permissions on the directory where you
installed the software to.  A quick way to check this would be to chmod to 0777
on the directory where PDMWeb is installed.

    DirectoryIndex not set to index.php as part of the web server config-
uration.  You should be able to run PDMWeb without having to enter a filename
into the browser page location.  If PDMWeb will not run without you having to
add 'index.php' to the browser's page location then your DirectoryIndex (or
equivalent if not running Apache) has not been set to include index.php.
Update your web server's configuration files, restart the server, and it should
now work.
